b"*  <DATE>4/3/2017</DATE> EDIT IV:  [Bloomberg](http://archive.is/bewC6) now reporting on <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s unmasking efforts."
b"The big takeaway here is that Nunes made a visit to <ORG>the White House</ORG> before his press conference to view <ORG>the National Security Council</ORG> systems that held the logs of <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s requests to unmask people that intelligence had been gathered on."
b'I think this explains why <GPE>Bannon</GPE> was added to the <ORG>NSC</ORG> - Trump has eyes and ears in an area that he would otherwise have been blind to.'

b'*  <DATE>4/3/2017</DATE> EDIT V:  Adding some small additional details that I uncovered from digging through the <ORG>Podesta</ORG> files.'
b'<ORG>Podesta</ORG> ID #[<CARDINAL>34639](https://wikileaks.org</CARDINAL>/podesta-emails/<ORG>emailid/34639</ORG>), which [better <ORG>detectives](https://www.reddit.com</ORG><SR>/r/The_Donald/comments/5a3de4/wikileaks_podesta_3469_appears_to_show_podesta/</SR>) than I concluded that this showed an effort at tying up <ORG>Trump, Assange</ORG>, and <GPE>Russia</GPE>.'

b'<ORG>Podesta</ORG> ID #[<ORG>17020](https://wikileaks.org</ORG>/podesta-emails/emailid/) also establishes a tenuous but still-present connection between <ORG>Podesta</ORG> and <ORG>the Atlantic Council</ORG>.'
b'*  <DATE>4/4/2017</DATE> <ORG>EDIT VI</ORG>:  As of <TIME>a few hours ago</TIME>, we now know slightly more [about what happened](http://dailycaller.com/2017/04/03/john-mccain-is-willing-to-testify-about-his-handling-of-trump-dossie<SR>r/</SR>) with the fake <NORP>Trump</NORP> dossier.'
b'<PERSON>Steele</PERSON> was not paid directly by the <ORG>FBI</ORG> as originally speculated - that deal appears to have fallen through, but <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON> was closely involved in negotiating that payment, leaving the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> connection valid.'
b'The firm involved with it, Fusion GPS, began working on the dossier in <DATE>September 2015</DATE>, hired by an anti-<ORG>Trump Republican</ORG> donor.'
b'That deal was broken off some time after that, and then a <NORP>Democratic</NORP> supporter of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> started paying <PERSON>Fusion GPS</PERSON> to keep going, and this is the point where <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> was brought into the project.'
b"*  <DATE>4/4/2017</DATE> EDIT VII:  [Contents](https://i.redd.it/zgwyjjqkflpy.png) of one of <ORG>the Department of State</ORG> emails (sent on <DATE>November 21, 2009</DATE>) recently declassified by the <ORG>FBI</ORG> indicate that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s infamous server was established to work around the intelligence-gathering systems that would later be used against President-elect <PERSON>Trump</PERSON>, or an ancestor to those systems."
b"I unfortunately don't remember who originally found this; I can't be credited with this discovery - only integrating it into the timeline."
b'*  4/5/2017 EDIT VIII:  Apparently [<PERSON>Susan Rice</PERSON> had a lot of friction](http://archive.is/uxr5E) with, of all the agencies, the *NSA*.'
b"<CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> fellow 'pede [summarized this very nicely](https://www.reddit.com<SR>/r/The_Donald/comments/63jho4/on_multiple_occasions_she_susan_rice_asked_the/dfumpge/</SR>)."
b'I have a feeling that this gives <ORG>Rogers</ORG> adequate motive to go to <ORG>Trump Tower</ORG> about the unmasking on <DATE>November 22</DATE> - she was horribly unpopular, possibly even coming to blows with <ORG>Rogers</ORG> himself.'
b'*  4/5/2017 EDIT IX: <ORG> New</ORG> information seems to implicate the one and only [<PERSON>John Brennan</PERSON> as the man who ordered enhanced surveillance](http://gotnews.com/breaking-barackobamas-cia-director-john-brennan-allies-targeting-trump-supporters-surveillance/) on key Trump allies, including General <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON>, <PERSON>Erik Prince</PERSON> (head of <PERSON>Blackwater</PERSON> and a top <ORG>CIA</ORG> critic), and <ORG>Sean Hannity</ORG>.'
b'<ORG>Brennan</ORG> was also the one to order <PERSON>Susan Rice</PERSON> to unmask those <NORP>Trump</NORP> allies.'
b"I've placed this in its rightful spot on the timeline."
b'*  4/5/2017 EDIT X: <PERSON> Man</PERSON>, <DATE>today</DATE> is the gift that keeps on giving.'
b"<ORG>Fox</ORG> published an [article](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/04/05/reports-in-unmasking-controversy-were-detailed-had-info-about-everyday-lives.html) describing that the intelligence reports involved here were uncomfortably detailed, but that's not what I'm interested in."
b'This report gives us a better understanding of when the unmasking campaign began, (concurrent with the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration\'s "investigation" into the <ORG>DNC</ORG> leaks) and tells us that <CARDINAL>only one</CARDINAL> agency would have the capability to fully trace back the paper trail that led back to <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>, as well as the fact that only one agency could approve unmasking requests - the <ORG>NSA</ORG>.'
b'*  4/6/2017 EDIT <GPE>XI</GPE>:  Further information about <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>\'s [continued access](http://thepoliticalinsider.com/obama-granted-hillary-top-secret-access-highly-classified-material-while-running-president/) to classified material even after leaving her post as Secretary of <ORG>State</ORG> in <DATE>2013</DATE> has surfaced, for the purpose of "writing her memoir" (emphasis on air-quotes mine).'
b'Beyond <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>, *<CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> staffers* had access to the same classified intelligence.'
b'I have a feeling that the <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> people are [on this list](http://archive.is/3578Y) - specifically, the <CARDINAL>five</CARDINAL> people involved with management and strategy (Mook, <PERSON>Benenson</PERSON>, <PERSON>Renteria</PERSON>, <ORG>Podesta</ORG>, and <PERSON>Abedin</PERSON>) and <PERSON>Cheryl Mills</PERSON>.'
b"This would explain classified information ending up on <PERSON>Weiner</PERSON>'s laptop, and <PERSON>Mills</PERSON>' request for [partial immunity](http://archive.is/d0yMG) in the email investigation back in <DATE>September</DATE>."
b"*  4/6/2017 EDIT <ORG>XII</ORG>:  ~~At the risk of making this seem implausible by not citing <PERSON>sources~~</PERSON> (~~who I'd like to keep private, though they are an active member of this <ORG>community~~</ORG> I have received permission to [cite this <ORG>source](https://np.reddit.com</ORG><SR>/r/The_Donald/comments/63szn9/nunes_steps_down_from_position_on_russia_probe/dfwq31g/</SR>)), it seems likely that Nunes discovered that he himself was unmasked by <ORG>Brennan</ORG>, <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON>, and/or <PERSON>Obama</PERSON>'s combined orders (there are <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL> points where unmaskings were ordered, it would seem - by <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON> before the election, by <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> starting in <DATE>December</DATE>, and then again by <PERSON>Brennan</PERSON> after the new intelligence-dissemination rules went into effect in <DATE>January</DATE>) - that's why he stepped away from the investigation."
b'Nunes was on the <NORP>Trump</NORP> transition team as of <DATE>December 1, 2016</DATE>.'
b'*  4/8/2017 EDIT XIII:  New [Wikileaks](https://www.reddit.com<SR>/r/The_Donald/comments/647cqt/woah_this_wikileaks_guccifer2_seth_rich_story/</SR>?st=J19FQPK2&amp;amp;sh=b9cc9769) release indicates that <GPE>Guccifer</GPE> <CARDINAL>2.0</CARDINAL>, an individual supposedly responsible for leaking the <ORG>DNC</ORG> emails to <PERSON>Wikileaks</PERSON> (in addition to other doccuments) was neither <NORP>Russian</NORP> (with <PERCENT>97%</PERCENT> certainty) and may have been a staffer named <PERSON>Warren Flood</PERSON> (or someone that stole his computer).'
b"<ORG>Wikileaks</ORG> does not [indicate that the <ORG>DNC</ORG> knew <ORG>Seth Rich</ORG> was the leaker](http://g-2.space/s<SR>r/dms</SR>.html), however, because when Rich was discussed in <PERSON>Guccifer</PERSON> <GPE>2.0</GPE>'s messages to a certain actress, he had been dead for <DATE>over a month</DATE>."
b'* 4/12/2017 EDIT <ORG>XIV</ORG>:  <ORG>CNN</ORG> [accidentally admits *(screenshot)*](https://i.redd.it/mwcg1wyup6ry.jpg) that <PERSON>John Podesta</PERSON> had ties to <GPE>Russia</GPE> via <ORG>the Podesta Group</ORG>.'
b'The <ORG>Podesta Group</ORG> represents, among other things, the interests of [<ORG>Sberbank of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sberbank_of_Russia</ORG>), which itself is owned by <ORG>the Central Bank of Russia</ORG> - which is part of the <NORP>Russian</NORP> government.'
b'The filing of <ORG>the Podesta Group</ORG> as a foreign agent is highly suspect on top of that.'
b"Perhaps the <GPE>Russia</GPE> narrative originated not out of revenge, but simply because the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> campaign (itself tied to <GPE>Russia</GPE>) assumed that <ORG>Trump's</ORG> campaign was doing the *exact same thing* they were."
b'*  4/18/2017 EDIT <GPE>XV</GPE>:  I have been informed of an [excellent summary](https://sharylattkisson.com/obama-era-surveillance-timeline/) of <PERSON>Obama-era</PERSON> wiretapping activities.'
b"Of note is that the single successful <LAW>FISA</LAW> request revolved around <PERSON>Carter Page's</PERSON> alleged <NORP>Russian</NORP> connections, likely stemming from very close ties to the <NORP>Russian</NORP> government."
b'This opened the door to <NORP>Trump</NORP> himself being officially spied on.'
b'*  4/18/2017 EDIT XVI:  <ORG>CNN</ORG> accidentally admits, [for the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> time](http://archive.is/detvj), more evil things.'
b'The <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> dossier was used by the <ORG>FBI</ORG> to justify FISA approval of surveillance of <PERSON>Carter Page</PERSON>.'
b'<ORG>Bear</ORG> in mind that <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> was under negotiation to be paid by Deputy Director <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON> for the dossier, and that <PERSON>Comey</PERSON> himself informed the <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> administration of what was in it.'
b'What does this mean?'
b'This means that the <ORG>FBI</ORG> *knew* it was full of shit (also why <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> was never paid), *but it was still used in a court of law as evidence*.'
b"Page is currently being leveraged because, being a <NORP>Russian</NORP> sympathizer, he is the weakest link in the <NORP>Trump</NORP> campaign and the most easily painted as a pro-<NORP>Russian</NORP> agent - and he was far removed from <ORG>Trump's</ORG> inner circle."
b'This is the length they had to go to to find some kind of <NORP>Russian</NORP> ties - faking evidence and hunting for <NORP>Russian</NORP> sympathizers, the latter of which was just found recently.'
b'*  4/23/2017 EDIT XVII:  Kind of small, but still important - the Failing NYT [confirmed](http://ibankcoin.com/zeropointnow/2017/04/23/nyt-fbi-refused-to-pay-50k-for-fisa-linked-trump-dossier-after-former-mi6-agent-failed-to-corroborate-claims/) that the <ORG>FBI</ORG> indeed attempted to pay <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> *$<MONEY>50,000</MONEY>* for the dossier - if he could prove the claims in it.'
b'It appears that <PERSON>Carter Page\'s</PERSON> visits to <GPE>Moscow</GPE> in <DATE>2016</DATE> - though they were innocuous, and though <PERSON>Page</PERSON> never met with <ORG>Trump -</ORG> were the legal foundation for much of the "<NORP>Russian</NORP> ties" claims (used for the FSIA request).'
b'The source of the <PERSON>Page</PERSON>-<GPE>Russia</GPE> connection, beyond <PERSON>Steele</PERSON>, was identified as <PERSON>Sergei Millian</PERSON>, a [particularly shady](http://dailycaller.com/2017/03/15/alleged-trump-dossier-source-has-overstated-his-business-connections/) <NORP>Belarusian</NORP>-American businessman.'
b'Page was also detested by the <ORG>Trump</ORG> campaign, and a cease-and-desist for calling himself a <NORP>Trump</NORP> advisor was sent to him in <DATE>December 2016</DATE>.'
b'* 4/25/2017 EDIT <ORG>XVIII</ORG>: <PERSON> Christopher Steele</PERSON> [admitted](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/ap<SR>r/25/christopher-steele-admits-dossier-charge-unverifie/</SR>) that the claims in his dossier were <PERCENT>100%</PERCENT> unverified.'
b"Apparently he's going to court over the fact that the contents of the dossier were printed; there's also some additional details of interest in here."
b'The "hacker" that <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> claimed was involved in all this was <PERSON>Aleksej Gubarev</PERSON>, who runs a web-hosting company, <ORG>XBT Holdings</ORG>.'
b"Additionally, it seems that it was not <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> himself who released the dossier to the media; instead, <PERSON>Fusion GPS</PERSON> took it and leaked it to try and damage the <ORG>Trump administration's</ORG> credibility."
b'<PERSON>Steele</PERSON> did have less formal communications with the media, though.'
b'We now have a place for the meeting between <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> and the <ORG>FBI</ORG> - <GPE>Rome</GPE>, <GPE>Italy</GPE>, at some unknown time.'
b'My timeline, approximately:\n\n*  The <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration most likely had been gathering intelligence on *every* <ORG>GOP</ORG> candidate - either as part of their expanded intel operations or as an intentional, focused sabotage plan.'
b"This information would likely have been contained in the President's Daily Briefings, which Nunes is rumored to have investigated on <DATE>March 22</DATE> - just before making the announcement that <ORG>Trump's</ORG> wiretapping claims were correct."
b"EDIT IV:  Though Nunes may have viewed the President's Daily Briefings at some point in his investigation, or intends to, it seems that the linchpin for Nunes was viewing the logs of <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s unmasking attempts."
b'*  <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> got wind of this investigation through her ability to access intelligence files and other means (i.e., direct ties to people in <GPE>DC</GPE> who were active in intelligence-gathering).'
b'This is where the "<NORP>Russian</NORP> hacker" narrative began, possibly bolstered by her relationship with <NORP>Alperovitch</NORP> - who is a <NORP>Russian</NORP> expat and absolutely loathes <PERSON>Vladimir Putin</PERSON>.'
b"She may have built a narrative out of <ORG>CrowdStrike</ORG>'s report, hopeful that the intel-gathering by the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration would uncover further information about <NORP>Russian</NORP> interference."
b'EDIT: <ORG> Evelyn Farkas</ORG>, who had been involved in <GPE>Russia</GPE>/<GPE>Ukraine</GPE> affairs, may also have been involved with this, again through <ORG>the Atlantic Council</ORG>.'
b'EDIT V: <ORG> Upon</ORG> digging through the <ORG>Podesta</ORG> files, it would seem that the Trump/Russia connection narrative was constructed just before <DATE>March 16, 2016</DATE>.'
b'<ORG>The Atlantic Council</ORG> had [a meeting](http://archive.is/XYi0A) about "combating far-right extremism in <LOC>Europe</LOC>" on <DATE>March 22</DATE> - less than <DATE>a week later</DATE>.'
b"I think it's possible that the <ORG>Atlantic Council</ORG> meeting on <DATE>the 22nd</DATE> was when the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> campaign, represented by <PERSON>John Podesta</PERSON> (who was in <GPE>DC</GPE> <DATE>the day</DATE> before the meeting, according to [<ORG>this](http://archive.is/tf9lo</ORG>) - <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> herself was in <GPE>Washington</GPE> state) exchanged information with <ORG>CrowdStrike</ORG>."
b"EDIT VII:  Since we can now establish that <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> was aware of a covert spying system as far back as <DATE>2009</DATE>, it's possible that she counted on that same system to uncover some kind of Trump/Russia connection."
b"EDIT <GPE>XI</GPE>:  Now we also know that there's a strong possibility that <CARDINAL>six</CARDINAL> of <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON>'s staffers also had access to classified intelligence - I wouldn't be surprised if they were involved in dissemination, either."
b'*  EDIT XIII:  <PERSON>Guccifer</PERSON> <CARDINAL>2.0</CARDINAL> emerges onto the scene on <DATE>June 15, 2016</DATE>, and claims responsibility for the <ORG>DNC</ORG> hacks that were teased by <ORG>Julian Assange</ORG> <DATE>barely three days earlier</DATE>.'
b'Signs indicate that this may have been some kind of damage control by the <ORG>DNC</ORG>, coming off of <ORG>the Podesta-Atlantic Council-CrowdStrike exchange</ORG> that likely happened <DATE>the previous month</DATE> - basically, releasing "additional" information while lazily incorporating <NORP>Russian</NORP> "fingerprints" (i.e., writing the metadata in <GPE>Cyrillic</GPE>) into those releases as a means of shifting the blame to <NORP>Russian</NORP> influence.'
b'This is the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL>-earliest point at which "<NORP>Russian</NORP> ties" had been discussed publicly, and I have a feeling that the <ORG>DNC</ORG> took marching orders from the <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> campaign (who had a discussion about <ORG>Trump/Putin/Assange</ORG> ties <DATE>two months before</DATE>, likely because they sensed a threat) in trying to sabotage <ORG>Trump</ORG>.'
b"Based off of some things that <GPE>Guccifer</GPE> 2.0 misinterpreted, it seems that he had <CARDINAL>zero</CARDINAL> connection to <ORG>CrowdStrike</ORG>'s report aside from reading it, so some insulation existed between the <ORG>DNC</ORG> and <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> campaign."
b'*  EDIT III: Oh boy.'
b'This - roughly <DATE>July</DATE> or <DATE>August</DATE> - is about the point at which, should the possibility laid out by <PERSON>Jonathan Langdale</PERSON> be correct (which <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON>\'s apparent "thumb\'s-up" lends extra credence to), <GPE>Russia</GPE> was responsible for approaching the <NORP>Trump</NORP> campaign and making them aware of the surveillance that was going on.'
b'Basically, Trump and <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> laid out a trap for <ORG>the "Council of Evil"</ORG> (which I\'ve come to call the <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON>/Rice/McCabe/Brennan/Clapper circle that seems to have been the main people involved with the <GPE>Russia</GPE> narrative) and the deep state, in which <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> would be made to seem untrustworthy in order to draw out and embolden leakers.'
b"They couldn't do anything about it, like go public with it, because it would jeopardize their chances of winning the election and thus prevent the campaign from investigating it further."
b"Additionally, the <ORG>FBI</ORG>'s actions with <PERSON>Clinton</PERSON> made them seem untrustworthy; it was readily obvious as well that the <GPE>DoJ</GPE> was compromised after <PERSON>Bill</PERSON>'s infamous meeting with <PERSON>Lynch</PERSON> on the tarmac - meaning they had nowhere to turn but inwards."
b"*  <ORG>CrowdStrike</ORG>'s report, which formed the backbone of <NORP>Russian</NORP> hacking allegations, found its way through the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL>-letter agencies and eventually indirectly caused the last FISA request over a <ORG>Trump-</ORG>controlled server to go through."
b"[EDIT III:  This may have been motivated by <GPE>Russia</GPE>'s detection of <ORG>Trump's</ORG> surveillance as hypothesized by <ORG>Langdale</ORG>] Several previous requests had been made, probably because the former (above EDIT III) bullet point happened in <DATE>around June or July</DATE>."
b'The <ORG>FBI</ORG> found nothing while investigating it.'
b"EDIT II: <ORG> Loretta Lynch's</ORG> ability to view unmasked intelligence documents may have played a role in allowing the <LAW>FISA</LAW> request to go through - likely as a way of building evidence for the brewing <NORP>Russian</NORP> hackers narrative."
b'* <ORG> EDIT VI:</ORG>  At around this point, the funding for Fusion GPS to create the <NORP>Trump</NORP> dossier dries up, shifting away from the unknown <NORP>Democrat</NORP>.'
b'<ORG>Clinton</ORG>, fearing that the <NORP>Russian</NORP> hacking narrative is on shaky grounds, indirectly pays off <PERSON>Andrew McCabe</PERSON> to come up with some kind of dirt on <PERSON>Trump</PERSON>.'
b'<PERSON>McCabe</PERSON> then begins negotiating hiring <PRODUCT>Fusion GPS</PRODUCT>, who has brought <PERSON>Christopher Steele</PERSON>, a former <ORG>MI6</ORG> agent, into their investigation.'
b'The money never makes it to Fusion GPS, and <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> spends <DATE>several months</DATE> "working" on it, sends it off to the mainstream media, and it floats around for <DATE>several months</DATE> until <ORG>Buzzfeed</ORG> publishes it as a means of undermining the <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> administration.'
b'<ORG>Bear</ORG> in mind that, by this point, the dossier had been in development for <DATE>over a year</DATE>.'
b"* <ORG> McCabe</ORG> believes <PERSON>Steele</PERSON>'s then-incomplete dossier, as well as <ORG>CrowdStrike</ORG>'s claims, and then begins to [plan a soft overthrow of <ORG>the Trump administration](http://archive.is/EiMua</ORG>) starting with the weakest link - <PERSON>Mike Flynn</PERSON>."
b"<PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> is later forced out due to his own faults, [EDIT III:  My original assumption here may be untrue, and this may have been part of a grander plan] but the assault doesn't stop there."
b"Comey may have been aware of <ORG>McCabe</ORG>'s actions, but ignored them."
b'[EDIT XVII:  This has been basically confirmed - the <ORG>FBI</ORG> knew of the dossier.]'
b'*  This is about the point where the media begins to go crazy over the "<NORP>Russian</NORP> ties" allegations, bolstered in some form or another by the <ORG>CrowdStrike</ORG> claims, <PERSON>Steele</PERSON>\'s dossier, and quite possibly leaks from <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON>\'s anti-Trump crusade in a kind of <PERSON>Deep Throat Jr.</PERSON> situation.'
b'I have a suspicion that <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON> and his <ORG>FBI</ORG>-based allies (the "McCabe 16" mentioned in the True Pundit article) were the source of the narrative.'
b'EDIT II:  The <ORG>CIA</ORG> under <ORG>Brennan</ORG> - because of his access to unmasked intelligence reports - may also have been involved with leaks to the media, especially via <ORG>the Washington Post</ORG>, which some have deemed the "mouthpiece of the <ORG>CIA</ORG>."'
b'* <ORG> EDIT</ORG> IX:  This is <DATE>approximately Election Day</DATE>.'
b"If the anonymous sources are indeed correct, then this is the point at which <ORG>CIA</ORG> director <PERSON>John Brennan</PERSON> orders enhanced surveillance on people in <ORG>Trump's</ORG> inner circle - like <PERSON>Mike Flynn</PERSON> (already targeted by the <ORG>FBI</ORG> under <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON>), <PERSON>Erik Prince</PERSON>, and <ORG>Sean Hannity</ORG>."
b"He may have also provided <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> with the specific documents or directions to find them that were later disseminated at the <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration's behest starting sometime in <DATE>December</DATE>."
b'<PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> was chosen due to the ease at which he could be leveraged; Hannity was chosen due to his apparent close ties to both <ORG>Trump and Julian Assange</ORG>, and Prince may have been focused on due to a long-standing personal feud with <ORG>Brennan</ORG>.'
b'The enhanced surveillance continues from <DATE>November 8 to January 20</DATE>.'
b'Note as well that this failed to turn up anything of note, as Director <PERSON>Clapper</PERSON> left office on <DATE>January 20</DATE> and [reported](http://legalinsurrection.com/2017/03/former-dni-head-clapper-no-evidence-of-ties-between-russia-trump/) on <DATE>March 6, 2017</DATE> that no evidence of <ORG>Trump-Russia</ORG> ties existed.'
b'In other words, the enhanced surveillance failed.'
b'* <ORG> EDIT VI</ORG>:  Thanks to the Daily Caller, we now know that <PERSON>John McCain</PERSON> learned about the dossier at <FAC>the Halifax International Security Forum</FAC>, which took place <DATE>between November 18 and November 20, 2016</DATE>.'
b'The person involved in bringing it to his attention was Sir <PERSON>Andrew Wood</PERSON>.'
b'<ORG>Wood</ORG> was a former ambassador for the <GPE>UK</GPE> to <GPE>Russia</GPE>, and knew <PERSON>Steele</PERSON> from his time at <ORG>MI6</ORG>.'
b'I have a suspicion that the exact date the discussion about the dossier happened was <DATE>November 19</DATE>, because <ORG>Wood</ORG> was involved in a panel on "<ORG>Maidan</ORG>, <ORG>Crimea</ORG> and the Obstacles to Democracy in <GPE>Ukraine</GPE>" on that date according to [the agenda](http://archive.is/LZZ0z).'
b'Wood flew back to the <GPE>UK</GPE>, met with <PERSON>Steele</PERSON>, and handed the dossier off to <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> <DATE>between November 19</DATE> (the last date I can confirm with reasonable certainty <ORG>Wood</ORG> was present in <GPE>Halifax</GPE>) and <DATE>December 9</DATE>, when <PERSON>McCain</PERSON> gave the dossier to <PERSON>James Comey</PERSON> during a meeting.'
b"Comey then briefed <ORG>Trump on the</ORG> existence of the dossier - which suggests to me that he was unaware of <PERSON>McCabe</PERSON>'s actions in trying to hire <PERSON>Fusion GPS - and</PERSON> once *that* meeting became known to the press, <ORG>BuzzFeed</ORG> published the complete dossier."
b"EDIT XVI:  Now we know that <PERSON>Steele</PERSON>'s dossier, likely the complete version handed to <PERSON>Comey</PERSON>, was used to bolster the <ORG>FBI</ORG>'s <LAW>FISA</LAW> request."
b'Highly suspicious, and indicates the document was laundered.'
b'*  EDIT X:  <DATE>Early December 2016</DATE>.'
b'The <PERSON>Obama</PERSON> administration announces the beginning of an investigation into the <ORG>DNC</ORG> hacks, and the requests for unmasked intelligence reports relating to this begin at around this point.'
b"I think it's likely that someone higher-up than <PERSON>Susan Rice</PERSON> ordered the unmasking, as the aforementioned paper trail through the <ORG>NSA</ORG> would have been immediately suspicious to the incoming <ORG>Trump administration</ORG>."
b"This may also explain <ORG>Rogers</ORG>' visit to <ORG>Trump Tower</ORG>, as unmasking in a less official manner had been going on for many months up to this point - this would merely be the latest effort to direct it at the <NORP>Trump</NORP> administration."
b'I suspect the higher-up who ordered <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> to do this was most likely <PERSON>John Brennan</PERSON>; he intended <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> to be his fall guy when <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> caught up to what was going on.'
b'*  The real unmasking begins once <ORG>Obama</ORG> amends <DATE>EO 12333</DATE> to encourage free sharing of information between the <CARDINAL>three</CARDINAL>-letter agencies, on <DATE>January 12</DATE>.'
b"The new rules were signed by <PERSON>Clapper</PERSON> on <DATE>December 15</DATE>, so it's reasonable to assume they had been floating around for a decently long time before that."
b'<DATE>Less than a month</DATE> before <ORG>Clapper</ORG> agrees to them, <ORG>NSA</ORG> head Admiral <PERSON>Rogers</PERSON> visits Trump in an infamous "unscheduled meeting," which draws ire from the rest of the intelligence community.'
b"It's obvious at this point that this was in order to warn the new administration of what was going on behind closed doors, likely including the information sharing."
b'*  <PERSON>Susan Rice</PERSON> orders the unmasking of all <NORP>Trump</NORP>-related intelligence at some point after the information sharing rules go into effect.'
b'This allowed intelligence previously collected on <ORG>Trump</ORG> and his family to be widely disseminated between the <ORG>FBI</ORG>, <ORG>CIA</ORG>, and <ORG>NSA</ORG>, and thus exponentially increased the chances of leakers spreading that information to the press - which can (and did) happen.'
b'<PERSON>McCabe</PERSON> was involved in this due to his desire to force <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> and then <NORP>Trump</NORP> out of office.'
b"<PERSON>Jeh Johnson</PERSON> may also have been involved in the unmasking process as well, but it's unclear as to what his position was."
b'*  EDIT III:  The trap from before the election was set; <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> volunteered to be the fall guy as already a kind of black sheep in the administration (by being the sole <NORP>Democrat</NORP>), and he baited the intelligence community into going after him just before the new inter-agency intelligence sharing rules took effect.'
b'It worked like a charm - the media latched on to it, and <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON> handed <NORP>Trump</NORP> his resignation letter as the whole intelligence community fell for it hook, line, and sinker.'
b'It was now obvious who the leakers were and where they were coming from.'
b"*  EDIT II: <LOC> Cernovich</LOC> revealed <TIME>tonight</TIME> that <PERSON>H. R. McMaster</PERSON> was responsible for discovering <PERSON>Rice</PERSON>'s actions, and he was responsible for sending an aide to Nunes in order to blow the lid open on what was going on."
b'This happened <DATE>between February 20</DATE> (when he assumed office) and <DATE>March 22</DATE> (when Nunes held his press conference).'
b'EDIT III:  <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON>, it should be noted, resigned <DATE>seven days</DATE> before <ORG>McMaster</ORG> took office; I don\'t think it\'s a coincidence that he uncovered what <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> was doing in just over a month - <PERSON>Flynn</PERSON>\'s dismissal drew all the termites out of the woodwork, and emboldened them in attempting to leak new, "damaging" information.'
b'The only effect this had was to highlight the leakers.'
b'*  <ORG>The White House</ORG> figures out all of this, or some key portions of this, <DATE>between January 20 and March 4</DATE>.'
b'Thus follows <ORG>Trump</ORG>\'s series of tweets discussing "wiretapping," and the rest is history.'
b'EDIT IV:  It wasn\'t until <DATE>early March</DATE> that <PERSON>Rice</PERSON> was pinned down as the unmasker by lawyers at <FAC>the White House</FAC>, so I tend to think that <ORG>Trump reported</ORG> on "wiretapping" almost as soon as the smoking gun was found.'

b'\xe2\x80\xa2 The size and scope of the breach has various numbers in the reporting.'
b'It appears that the case is still expanding.'
b'This is why quoted text may have conflicting numbers.'
b'Earlier articles were still revealing the scope of the breach.'
b'\xe2\x80\xa2 The numbers vary in the reporting but <CARDINAL>four</CARDINAL> <ORG>Pakistani Brothers</ORG>, <PERSON>Imran Awan</PERSON>, <PERSON>Abid Awan</PERSON> and <PERSON>Jamal Moiz Awan</PERSON>, and <CARDINAL>2</CARDINAL> wives get an IT job in <ORG>Congress</ORG>.'
b'Their has been some mention of a possible unrelated party involved as well.'
b'&gt;Additionally, it was revealed that these employees were paid <CARDINAL>more than three</CARDINAL> times the salary of a \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d IT worker, grossing upwards of <MONEY>$5 million dollars</MONEY> combined during their tenure as IT professionals.'
b'While the average government IT professional earns <MONEY>about $55,000</MONEY> per year, <ORG>Imran Awan</ORG> was being paid $<MONEY>165,130</MONEY>, <PERSON>Abid Awan</PERSON> grossed $<MONEY>164,980</MONEY> per annum, and <PERSON>Jamal Awan</PERSON> $<MONEY>157,577</MONEY> according to government records.'
b'&gt;Soon after <GPE>Imran</GPE> began working for members of <ORG>Congress</ORG>, <GPE>Imran</GPE>\xe2\x80\x99s and <PERSON>Abid</PERSON>\xe2\x80\x99s wives \xe2\x80\x94 Hina Alvi and <GPE>Natalia</GPE> <ORG>Sova \xe2\x80\x94</ORG> also began receiving [congressional paychecks](http://dailycaller.com/2017/02/20/exclusive-house-dem-it-guys-in-security-probe-secretly-took-100k-in-iraqi-money/), The <ORG>DCNF</ORG> found.'
b'<GPE>Imran</GPE>\xe2\x80\x99s employers included <CARDINAL>two</CARDINAL> members of the intelligence committee, <GPE>Indiana</GPE> <NORP>Democrat</NORP> Rep. <PERSON>Andre Carson</PERSON> and <GPE>California</GPE> <NORP>Democrat</NORP> Rep. <PERSON>Jackie Speier</PERSON>.'
b'\xe2\x80\xa2 From <DATE>2004/2005</DATE> <GPE>Imran</GPE> and his brothers work their way in to <ORG>Capitol Hill</ORG> staffer jobs to an unspecified number of Congressmen.'
b'The reporting ranges from <CARDINAL>30 to 80</CARDINAL> depending on the article cited.'
b'It appears that <CARDINAL>about 30</CARDINAL> representatives added the <PERSON>Awan</PERSON> brothers to their payroll, but they may have done associated and work for about <CARDINAL>80</CARDINAL> representatives.'
b"&gt;Imran Awan has a longtime relationship with some members of <ORG>Congress</ORG>, including working for <ORG>Meeks</ORG> and <GPE>Becerra</GPE> starting in <DATE>2004</DATE> and joining <PERSON>Wasserman Schultz's</PERSON> office in <DATE>2005</DATE>."
b'The IT staffer position expanded to include <CARDINAL>more than 30</CARDINAL> representatives, including  work under congressional members who were members of top secret level congressional committees (DHS, Foreign affairs, <GPE>Select</GPE> intelligence committee).'
b'&gt;Although personal office computers are not supposed to be used for <ORG>Intelligence Committee</ORG> business or classified material, [accessing these <ORG>computers](https://m.townhall.com</ORG>/columnists/fredfleitz/2017/02/23/another-major-democratic-email-scandal-the-news-media-is-ignoring-n2289705) is a high priority for foreign intelligence services because of the information they could glean about the committee\xe2\x80\x99s work from unclassified emails.'
b'Their is contested information that the <PERSON>Awan</PERSON> brothers did get access to sensitive and classified information.'
b'While the emails and internal correspondence would be considered sensitive, but I have yet to confirm classified information was compromised, however a lot of circumstantial evidence prevent me from ruling out the possibility.'
b'\xe2\x80\xa2The brothers are suspected of serious violations including accessing members\xe2\x80\x99 computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from <ORG>Congress</ORG>, over billing congress for work and parts, transferring data to a remote server, and bypassing normal security protocols for IT staff.'
b'Their <NORP>Democrat</NORP> benefactors allowed the breech of policy for the sake of convenience.'
b'\xe2\x80\xa2 The <NORP>Awans</NORP> operated an external server, which is against all protocols concerning secured government information.'
b'&gt;Further, there were instances where [<ORG>House</ORG> information was discovered in an external \xe2\x80\x9ccloud\xe2\x80\x9d server](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/03/police-probing-it-contractors-for-house-dems-over-unauthorized-computer-access.html).'
b'The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing <ORG>House</ORG>-related information in that off-site server.'
b'\xe2\x80\xa2 The <NORP>Awans</NORP> had special access to <FAC>the White House</FAC> and for <ORG>Visas</ORG>.'
b'\xe2\x80\xa2 <ORG>Multiple</ORG> <NORP>Democratic</NORP> lawmakers have yet to cut ties with <ORG>House</ORG> staffers under criminal investigation for wide-ranging equipment and data theft.'
b'``Imran Awan, a longtime <ORG>House</ORG> staffer who worked for <CARDINAL>more than two dozen</CARDINAL> <NORP>Democrats</NORP> since <DATE>2004</DATE>, is still employed by Rep. <PERSON>Debbie Wasserman</PERSON> (As of <DATE>March 5, 2017</DATE>)\n\n\n\nIn my <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> [<ORG>article](https://www.reddit.com</ORG><SR>/r/conspiracy/comments/60l4pu/the_awan_brothers_compromised_at_least_80/</SR>) I glossed over the kidnapping of the "stepmother" not understanding the significance of the event.'
b"When I read the [<LOC>Fairfax</LOC> County Police report](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3516620-Abid-Awan-s-stepmother-calls-the-police-on-the.html) it just didn't grab my attention."
b'<CARDINAL>One</CARDINAL> fact I missed was the use of electronic surveillance to control the movements and actions of the stepmother.'
b'I also failed to understand the <PERSON>Awan</PERSON> brothers were trying to gain access to funds in <GPE>Pakistan</GPE>.'
b'&gt;Congressional staffers allegedly held their stepmother in \xe2\x80\x9ccaptivity\xe2\x80\x9d with violent threats in a plan to use her to access money stashed away in <LOC>the Middle East</LOC>.'
b'The staffers are suspected of using their positions to enrich themselves.'
b'<ORG>\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n&gt;\xe2\x80\x9cThey</ORG> kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from <DATE>October 16, 2016 to February 2</DATE>,\xe2\x80\x9d the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone.'
b'The fact that she did not speak <LANGUAGE>English</LANGUAGE> made it easy for them to take advantage of her.'
b'<ORG>\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n&</ORG>gt;The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her \xe2\x80\x9cher movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to.'
b'They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n&gt;But as soon as <ORG>Shah</ORG> passed away, they came into the house and \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever documents were there they stole, a couple laptops which were their father\xe2\x80\x99s property, and left for <GPE>Pakistan</GPE>.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n<MONEY>###</MONEY>And left for <GPE>Pakistan</GPE>...\n\n<MONEY>###</MONEY>This article proves a number of things that should be explored.'
b'<MONEY>###</MONEY>The <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> would be the use of surveillance equipment on the stepmother.'
b'Yes, I will concede that they could have bought the equipment to watch their stepmother, but I believe that is unlikely.'
b'The skills to run a surveillance operation are beyond most IT techs.'
b"It's not that they couldn't figure it out, they just wouldn't have the equipment."
b'While the price is dropping, running an effective bugging operation is expensive and time consuming.'
b"Let's consider for they moment the brothers had the equipment for other jobs and repurposed the equipment for their surveillance of the stepmother."
b'This brings us to the <ORDINAL>first</ORDINAL> logical leap...\n\nHow many of you have used an in-line key logger?'
b"It's a simple, inexpensive device that can't be detected by antivirus software."
b'It operates outside of the <ORG>OS</ORG> plugged into the <ORG>USB</ORG> port then the keyboard is plugged into the logger.'
b'The only real problem is obtaining access to deploy and recover the device.'
b'This brings us to the break ins.'
b'Why did the Awan brothers break in to <CARDINAL>20</CARDINAL>+ <ORG>Congressional</ORG> offices when they already had full admin and remote access to the computers.'
b"It has already been proven they could access/edit/delete all the Congressmen's email, files, everything."
b'It is even possible to remotely format a system.'
b'They could even transfer data to a remote off site server.'
b'There was no reason to break in to the offices to recover data, so what were they after?'
b'I believe it was to recover something other than data.'
b'It only stands to reason they had to recover surveillance equipment and or <ORG>Spyware</ORG> installed in the offices and systems.'
b'They were running a bugging operation on congress and had to retrieve the equipment before they lost access to it.'
b'#The <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> is why did they run?'
b'Here is the <ORDINAL>second</ORDINAL> logical leap.'
b'They began controlling the movement of their stepmother on <DATE>the 16th of October, 2016</DATE>.'
b'No one at least in the <NORP>Democrat</NORP> party even entertained the possibility hillary would not be the next president.'
b'Even the pro <PERSON>Trump</PERSON> supporters had to admit he was a long shot until <TIME>9pm</TIME> on <TIME>election night</TIME>.'
b'Almost everybody believed hillary would win and the bodies would stay buried forever.'
b'Imran was familiar with the clintons and it has been reported <GPE>Imran</GPE> was quite friendly with bill clinton.'
b'He was about to dramatically expand his sphere of influence.'
b'The <PERSON>Awan</PERSON> brothers had no obvious reason for consolidating their assets and running to <GPE>Pakistan</GPE>.'
b'They began their consolidation of assets some time before <DATE>October 16th</DATE>.'
b'This implies planning and fore thought.'
b'They knew something was coming.'
b'What could have been lucrative enough or dangerous enough to have caused the need to pack up shop and get out of town Was it the health of their father that caused the need to control the family assets?'
b'They were clearly attempting to get control of the father\'s, <PERSON>Muhammad Shah</PERSON>, assets and power of attorney here and later in <GPE>Pakistan</GPE> to "inherit" the family assets, but that would not have been cause to run.'
b'They could have acquired the assets and remained in <GPE>the United States</GPE>.'
b'It has already been shown they had enough clout to get past any problems the stepmother could have caused.'
b'That would not have required a break in to <CARDINAL>20</CARDINAL> congressional offices and a complete exodus of <GPE>the United States</GPE>.'
b'In view of the events we know that was an exaggerated response to events, or something else had to change.'
b'Was it the <ORG>DNC</ORG> hack?'
b'The <CARDINAL>wikileaks</CARDINAL> of email systems they protected?'
b'Was it the proposed changes to the security clearance for staffers that made them run?'
b'Could it have been the new policy of <ORG>FBI</ORG> background checks for staffers and the request for a Top Secret/Compartmentalized information request for investigation of staffers attached to <ORG>the Congressional Intelligence Committee</ORG>.'
b'Rep. <PERSON>Debbie Wasserman-Schultz</PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON>Jackie Speier</PERSON> recommended <ORG>the Awan Brothers</ORG> for their positions and asked for their [<ORG>TOP</ORG> SECRET (<ORG>TS/SCI</ORG>) <ORG>CLEARANCE](https://fas.org</ORG>/irp/congress/2016_c<SR>r/hpsci-hac</SR>.pdf).'
b'This .pdf is a request for a budget addition of $<MONEY>125,000</MONEY> to conduct background investigations for the highest level of top secret/compartmentalized information (<ORG>TS/SCI</ORG>) clearance for <ORG>Intelligence</ORG> committee staffers.'
b'This is speculation, but the <PERSON>Awan</PERSON> brothers were getting the brass ring.'
b'They had access to congressional data that would only increase with the clearance.'
b'This brings in an angle of the story I had found little published information on <ORG>Nanoset Technologies</ORG>, but what has been reported in <SR>r/</SR><ORG>TruthLeaks</ORG> is the beginning of something solid on the <PERSON>Awan</PERSON> brothers web of business interests.'
b"<MONEY>###</MONEY><ORG>Nanoset Technologies\n\n&gt;Nanoset Technologies</ORG> were a government contractor that sells IT equipment to the government, but the <NORP>Awans</NORP> were officers in that company while they were staff, which is a conflict-of-interest {{ But it's also a way to get equipment with backdoors into the Congress }}<ORG>\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n&gt;There</ORG> is a well-known <GPE>Bangladeshi</GPE> doctor at the <GPE>VA</GPE> in <GPE>Baltimore</GPE>, <GPE>MD</GPE> [name redacted]."
b'She was living with the <NORP>Awans</NORP>, and was doing business with the <NORP>Awans</NORP>--an odd mix of IT and Medicine.'
b'She became a CEO of <ORG>Nanoset Technology</ORG> while she was an <GPE>MD</GPE> at the <GPE>VA</GPE>, and the business listed is just a condo.'
b'How much biz did they do with <ORG>the US Government</ORG>?'
b'This would have been very lucrative for their business and open a whole new horizon of contacts and government pork they could bid on, why would the run?'
b'What would the investigation turn up?'
b"I have to admit I don't know the answer here, but it doesn't make sense."
b'What I do know is we have not been provided a good reason for why they were planning their escape to <GPE>Pakistan</GPE> prior to <DATE>October 16th, 2016</DATE>.'
